## Background

In today‚Äôs competitive job market, understanding the demand for various analyst roles and the associated skills is crucial for both job seekers and employers. This project emerged from a need to gain a deeper understanding of the current job market dynamics, particularly for data analysts, business analysts, and other related roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

  - **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
  - **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the analyst job posting data.
  - **DBeaver**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
  - **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

## Analysis

To focus on the analyst job roles only we will filter the data: 

```sql
  -- Data analyst job roles
  SELECT 
      jp.job_link,
      jp.job_title,
      jp.is_being_worked,
      jp.job_level,
      jp.job_type,
      js.job_skills
  FROM 
      job_postings AS jp
  INNER JOIN job_skills AS js 
  ON jp.job_link = js.job_link
  WHERE LOWER(job_title) LIKE '%analyst%';
  ```

#### N/B: The job postings table contains only posting that are active.
```sql
  -- Active data analyst job role
  SELECT
    last_status,
    count(last_status) cnt
  FROM
    job_postings
  WHERE LOWER(job_title) LIKE '%analyst%' 
  GROUP BY last_status 
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```

### 1. Descriptive Analysis:
 - **Count of Analyst Jobs**: Determine the total number of analyst job postings.
    ```sql
    SELECT
      count(job_link) AS data_jobs
    FROM
      job_postings
    WHERE
      LOWER(job_title) LIKE '%analyst%' ;
